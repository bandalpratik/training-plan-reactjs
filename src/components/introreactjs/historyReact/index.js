        <p>
          React is a new technology when compared with other technologies in the
          market. It came into existence in 2011, when Jordan Walke, a software
          engineer at Facebook created the library. React is influenced by the
          likes of XHP which is a simple HTML component framework for PHP. The
          first use case of React was in Facebookâ€™s newsfeed in 2011. Later on,
          it is picked up by Instagram to use it in their system.{" "}
          <strong>
            With time, React grew, and Facebook decided to make it open source
            in May 2013 at JSConf US.
          </strong>{" "}
          In 2015 JSConf, React Native was announced which enabled easy
          development with Android and iOS deveopment. In the same year, React
          Native was open-sourced to help it grow.

            Some notable features which have helped make React so beloved by
            developers are its use of Components, the Virtual DOM, Lifecycle
            Methods, JSX, and React hooks.
          </strong>{" "}
          Diving into the pros, cons, and use cases of each of these specific
          features deserve to (and will) be explored in their own deep diving
          articles. But on a surface level they all combine to give React three
          main advantages which helped build and now sustain its immense
          success. Those three advantages are: clean programming, fast
          performance, and a strong community. By clean programming we mean that
          React gives us the ability to write code that is very easy to read and
          easy to reuse when compared to its competitors. By fast performance we
          mean that React provides a very quick response time which is optimal
          when aiming to create popular user interfaces and experiences. By
          strong community we mean that if you have a potential need for a
          package while using React , you can bet that the vast majority of the
          time theres already one out there available for you to use. With over
          13,500 commits on Github and over 231,000 related questions on Stack
          Overflow, the list of resources to remedy potential road blocks faced
          while using React is almost endless.

          Some of the major companies that currently use React include: Netflix,
          Facebook, Instagram, Airbnb, Reddit, Dropbox, and Postmates. The use
          of React by these economic and cultural behemoths is only further
          proof of the value and demand that React holds in the current
          employment marketplace. In an ever evolving landscape of software
          development tools, React seems poised to maintain its wide use and
          relevance well into to foreseeable future.
